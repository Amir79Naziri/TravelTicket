This project was for Software Engineering Course at [Amir Kabir University of thechnology](https://aut.ac.ir/) and The development method was Agile programming so we used scrum framework. 

First of all we gathered the Requirements of the software in overall 68 user stories and we wrote them in a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pqyAl0lZE0XD-jqe7LzcgKUCFYOFHEbvCjAbA8HWHeg/edit?usp=sharing) then we scored them using [Plan it poker](https://www.planitpoker.com/board/#/rooms) after that we selected 12 user stories and decided to develop the in the first sprint.

we had daily scrum sessions, which we discussed about every problem that we faced during development. The software development tool that we used for agile developing was JIRA from [Atlassian software company.](https://www.atlassian.com/)



Of course, the program is not complete and we just developed the first sprint of the program so it is just a demo that show's the main requirements of a ticket selling application. We developed a complete server for user information but there isn't any sever for tickets, In order that, we have some sample tickets. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this Project!
